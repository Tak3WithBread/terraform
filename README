- "vm_flavor": VM flavor
- "vm_image": VM image
- "vpc_cidr": VPC CIDR block
- "subnet_cidr" : Subnet CIDR block

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a "terraform.tfvars" file based on "variables.tfvars"
3. Run "terraform init", "terraform plan", and "terraform apply"

## Example `terraform.tfvars`

vm_count    = 3
vm_flavor   = "t2.micro"
vm_image    = "ami-0fc5d935ebf8bc3bc"
vpc_cidr    = "172.31.0.0/24"
subnet_cidr = "172.31.0.0/24"


Ensure that you have AWS CLI configured with appropriate access credentials and that your AWS CLI session is authenticated.
You can do this by running aws configure and providing your AWS access key, secret key, region, and preferred output format.
